    Solution for Project Euler Problem 21
    Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
    If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
    
    Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
